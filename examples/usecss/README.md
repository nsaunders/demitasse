This example project demonstrates how to use Demitasse to create a custom `useCSS` hook featuring locally-scoped CSS and typed bindings.

> **Warning**
> This adds the style sheet to the document at runtime. Generally we recommend the simpler and more efficient approach demonstrated in the other [examples](../examples) of extracting static CSS at build time.

## Scripts

* `npm start` starts the Webpack development server.
* `npm run bundle` creates a production build of the application.
