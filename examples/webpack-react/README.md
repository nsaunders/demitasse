This example project demonstrates how to use Demitasse with Webpack and React.

> **Note**
> Demitasse is not tied to a specific framework. React is used for illustrative purposes due to its popularity and convenient API.

## Scripts

* `npm start` starts the Webpack development server.
* `npm run bundle` creates a production build of the application.

## Guide

If you would prefer a detailed walkthrough, we recommend the [Webpack guide](../../docs/guides/webpack.md).
